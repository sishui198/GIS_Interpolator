GIS_Interpolator
================

Team Final Project - CSCI 7090 - Knowledge Process for GIS Data

Interpolates unknown measurements for spatio-temporal points based upon user-inputted data files using an inverse-distance-weighted-extension method. This method utilizes a k-nearest neighbor classifier. Also implements leave-one-out cross validation and error measurement reporting to measure the success of the interpolation method. Desktop application developed in C# / .NET and SharpMap is used to visually map the data points.
